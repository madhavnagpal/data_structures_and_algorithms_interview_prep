/*

An array is a collection of elements of the same type placed in contiguous memory locations.

Unlike arrays, size of vectors can change dynamically, with their storage being handled
automatically by the container.

Unlike Arrays, Vectors are passed by value to a function, you may still pass
them by reference if need arises.
